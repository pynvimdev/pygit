# Pygit

Its a simple python git tool used to push and pull code

### Why
-------------------------

I have seen many people struggling with setting up a authorization token, then with git problems etc. So this
script would automatically push code to github(as of now). Also requires github token to be created, but rest of the configs etc are automated(For Begginers)

### TODO
------------------------
- Save auth to local machine
- Encypt cached auth
